## Context

The [testing-agents](../problems/testing-agents.md) problem doc identifies a
gap: we have CI for code but no CI for prompts. It surveys prompt-level eval
frameworks (promptfoo, deepeval) and agent-level runners (Inspect AI), but
notes that most eval frameworks test prompts, not agents — they send a single
prompt to a model API and score the response, without exercising the full
agent loop (tool calls, multi-turn reasoning, environment interaction).

Prior attempts to run agent tests were cut short because agents misbehaved
during test runs — misusing credentials and producing side effects outside
the test boundary. The sandboxed execution model introduced in
[ADR 0036](0036-agent-execution-sandbox.md) changed this: agents now run in
containers with controlled network access and scoped credentials, limiting
blast radius enough to make test suites practical.

PR [#1682](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/pull/1682) introduces a
functional test framework that tests the complete agent pipeline (pre-script,
agent execution, post-script) running against ephemeral GitHub fixtures and
scored by an LLM judge. A key property of functional tests is that they
verify post-scripts and credential use actually work against real external
services — not just that the agent produces plausible output, but that the
full pipeline's interaction with GitHub (labeling, commenting, state
transitions) succeeds end-to-end.

This creates a new test category that needs a name and a place in the testing
taxonomy. The emerging test pyramid for this project has four layers:

1. **Unit tests** — deterministic Go tests (`make go-test`). Cheap, fast,
   plentiful.
2. **Prompt evals** — test agent prompts and skills in isolation, with mocked
   external dependencies (not yet implemented). Cheaper than functional tests
   because they avoid real service interactions, so they can be more numerous
   and provide broader coverage. Custom network policies could enforce the
   mocking boundary. [vercel-labs/emulate](https://github.com/vercel-labs/emulate)
   may be useful for mocking external APIs at this layer.
3. **Functional tests** — exercise the full agent pipeline against real
   GitHub fixtures. More expensive because they interact with live services,
   so their number should be kept deliberately small — enough to cover the
   critical integration paths, not exhaustive.
4. **E2e tests** — browser-driven install/uninstall flows (`make e2e-test`).
   The most expensive layer; limited to a narrow happy-path verification of
   the admin install/uninstall flow.

Each layer up the pyramid costs more per case and should therefore have fewer
cases. This ADR addresses layer 3. Layer 2 remains an open opportunity
(tracked in [#73](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/issues/73)).

### A note on naming

An earlier draft of this ADR called these "functional evals." We now
distinguish between *tests* and *evals*: functional tests verify that agent
pipelines produce correct side effects for a small number of hand-crafted
cases. *Evals* are something different — you run many of them to build
statistical confidence in agent performance across a distribution of inputs.
True evals belong at layer 2 (prompt evals) where mocked external APIs make
high case counts affordable. These functional tests are closer to integration
tests than to evals, and naming them as tests sets the right expectations
about their purpose and cost.

## Decision

We adopt **functional tests** as a distinct test category for agent pipelines.

A functional test exercises the full `fullsend run` pipeline — dispatch,
sandbox setup, agent execution, and post-processing — against a controlled
GitHub fixture (ephemeral repo + issue/PR), then scores the agent's observable
side effects (labels applied, comments posted, PR state) using both
deterministic checks and LLM-graded rubrics.

The test infrastructure lives in `eval/` at the repo root, organized per
agent skill:

```
eval/
  fullsend-runner.sh          # CLI runner: fixture setup -> fullsend run -> capture state
  run-functional.sh           # Orchestrator: iterate cases, score
  <skill>/
    eval.yaml                 # Test config: judges, thresholds, models
    cases/
      001-<name>/
        input.yaml            # Fixture definition
        annotations.yaml      # Expected state and rubric hints
        repo/                 # Source tree the agent sees
    repos/                    # Shared repo content, symlinked by cases
```

Functional tests run in CI when `eval/` or `internal/scaffold/` changes, and
are triggered via `make functional-tests`. They are gated on score thresholds
(e.g., `min_mean: 2.5` for LLM quality, `min_pass_rate: 0.9` for
deterministic checks) rather than binary pass/fail, acknowledging the
non-determinism inherent in agent behavior.

## Consequences

- The test pyramid now has three implemented layers (unit, functional test,
  e2e) with a fourth (prompt eval) identified but not yet built. Each layer
  has a distinct scope, cost profile, and trigger.
- Functional tests require cloud credentials (GCP for Vertex AI, GitHub token
  for fixture repos), so they cannot run in unprivileged CI contexts.
- Adding a new agent skill's tests requires only a new directory under `eval/`
  with the standard case layout — no framework code changes.
- LLM-as-judge introduces a second layer of non-determinism: both the agent
  under test and the judge are probabilistic. Threshold-based gating mitigates
  this but does not eliminate flakiness.
- The `eval/` directory is a new top-level concern that contributors need to
  know about. Documentation belongs in `docs/testing/functional-tests.md`.
- Functional test count should be monitored to prevent bloat. Because each
  case interacts with live services, the suite's cost and runtime scale
  directly with case count.
- This decision does not preclude a lighter-weight prompt eval layer that
  tests agent prompts and skills without the full pipeline. Such a layer
  would complement functional tests by covering more cases at lower cost.
  Statistical agent evals are tracked in
  [#73](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/issues/73).
