# 47. agent-eval-harness for test infrastructure

## Context

[ADR 0048](0048-functional-tests-for-agent-pipelines.md) establishes
functional tests as a test category for agent pipelines. That decision is
silent on which framework orchestrates them — it could be custom scripts,
Inspect AI, or something else.

Building test infrastructure from scratch is expensive and tangential to our
core problem. We need test case management, judge orchestration, scoring,
threshold gating, and regression detection. We do not need to build any of
these ourselves.

[agent-eval-harness](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/agent-eval-harness)
is a generic evaluation framework for agents and skills. It provides dataset
management, LLM-graded and deterministic judges, scoring pipelines, MLflow
integration, and an
[opaque CLI runner contract](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/agent-eval-harness/blob/main/docs/opaque-cli-runner-contract.md)
that delegates execution to an external command. The CLI runner was added in
[issue #59](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/agent-eval-harness/issues/59),
which we filed specifically to make `fullsend run` testable without forking
or extending the harness with fullsend-specific code.

## Decision

We adopt agent-eval-harness as the framework for fullsend functional tests.
Fullsend's `eval/scripts/run-fullsend.sh` implements the opaque CLI runner
contract — it accepts a workspace and output directory, runs `fullsend run`
inside a sandbox, and writes captured fixture state to the output directory.
Everything upstream (case iteration, judge invocation, scoring, thresholds)
is handled by agent-eval-harness.

When adding new test capabilities, prefer extending or contributing to
agent-eval-harness over building fullsend-specific tooling.

## Consequences

- Fullsend functional tests inherit agent-eval-harness capabilities (MLflow
  logging, pairwise comparison, dataset generation) without building them.
- The opaque CLI runner contract is the integration boundary. Fullsend owns
  execution; the harness owns everything else.
- agent-eval-harness becomes a runtime dependency for test execution, adding
  a Python dependency alongside the Go codebase.
- Bugs or gaps in agent-eval-harness may require upstream contributions. We
  have already done this once (issue #59).
- Future prompt evals (layer 2 in the test pyramid) can reuse the same
  harness with a different runner, keeping test infrastructure unified.
- This decision, like any ADR, can be reversed or superseded. If we find a
  better framework or discover that agent-eval-harness limits us in practice,
  we can switch. The purpose of this ADR is to drive consistency for the
  foreseeable future, not to lock us in permanently.
